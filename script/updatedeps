# Say so if any deps are unused but still in the lockfile.
# Mix won't automatically remove them because, I think, they can be conditionally used in a way it won't detect.
# Commands like "mix deps.unlock --unused" will remove them for us. Perhaps we'll run those commands here instead of just checking, later.
