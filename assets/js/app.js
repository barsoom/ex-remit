/* CONNECTION DETECTION AND NEW DEPLOY DETECTION
 *
 * We set up our own socket and channel to handle two scenarios:
 *
 * 1. You've lost your connection for a while (computer sleep, network blipâ€¦). We detect it via pings from the server, and reload the page to ensure you didn't miss any updates. See: https://elixirforum.com/t/can-phoenix-channel-detect-client-offline-immediately-like-wifi-disconnected/25104/18
 *
 * 2. A new revision of the app is deployed, so we should reload the page to ensure you use the new revision. Heroku will close the socket briefly during deploy, causing a reconnection. We detect that reconnect, and reload the page.
 *
 * We can't rely on #1 alone, since the restart may be quicker than our ping-detection threshold. We also can't rely solely on #2, because it is only likely to reconnect quickly when the socket is shut down cleanly on the server and tells the client. Otherwise it can take a minute or so for the client to realise the socket is dead.
 *
 * We try to strike a balance between not triggering at every brief connection blip, and detecting longer blips quickly, but there are no guarantees that we can't miss ill-timed broadcasts during a below-the-threshold blip. That's acceptable for this app.
