# Remit

A self-hosted web app for [commit-by-commit code review](https://thepugautomatic.com/2014/02/code-review/), written using [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) [LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view).

A lab project by [Henrik](https://henrik.nyh.se) started ca 2020-05-15. [See status.](https://github.com/barsoom/ex-remit/issues/1)

## What's the big idea?

You'll add a GitHub webhook to each repo you want to review (see instructions below). This means GitHub sends all new commits and comments to Remit.

Remit shows commits and lets you mark them as reviewed. Clicking a commit opens the commit page on GitHub, where you can write comments either line-by-line or on the commit as a whole.

Remit also shows you comments and lets you mark these as resolved, so you don't miss the feedback you got.

When new commits and comments arrive, or when a co-worker starts a review, you see it all in real time.

We recommend putting Remit inside [Fluid.app](https://fluidapp.com/) or equivalent so you can see Remit and the GitHub commit pages side-by-side. (We can't put GitHub inside an iframe, because they disallow it.)

### Setting up Fluid.app

TODO: Instructions

### Without Fluid.app

Links to commits will open in the same browser window/tab every time. So after clicking a link the first time, you can put this tab/window side-by-side with the Remit window (typically by dragging the tab out of the tab bar into its own window).

It won't be as convenient as with Fluid.app, but good in a pinch!


## Dev

Assumed to be run *outside* of devbox, at the time of writing.

First time:

    # Creates DB, migrates, seeds
    mix ecto.setup

Every time:

    mix phx.server

Then visit <http://localhost:4000?auth_key=dev>

You can run this to fake new commits coming in via webhook:

    mix wh.commits

It defaults to 5 commits, but you can pass a count:

    mix wh.commits 123

### Maintenance

    mix deps.update --all    # Update Hex deps.
    cd assets && npm update  # Update JS deps.
    mix test                 # Verify things didn't break.

## Production

The `POOL_SIZE` for the running dyno is 18, so we've got 2 spare on a Heroku hobby plan.

Deploy:

    script/deploy

Console:

    script/prodc

Need to reset the DB on Heroku because you've rethought everything about the DB? Carefully:

    heroku pg:info  # Get DB name, e.g. dancing-nimbly-12345
    heroku pg:reset dancing-nimbly-12345
    heroku run "POOL_SIZE=2 mix ecto.migrate"

### Setup

Configure ENV variables for `AUTH_KEY` and `WEBHOOK_KEY`.

Add a webhook on each reviewed repo in GitHub (at Auctionet, we've got scripts to do this in batch).

The hook should be something like:

    Payload URL: https://my-remit.herokuapp.com/webhooks/github?auth_key=your_WEBHOOK_KEY_value
    Content type: application/json
    Secret: (left empty â€“ it's part of the URL instead)
    Select events:
    - Commit comments
    - Pushes

You should see a happy green checkmark on GitHub, and if you click the hook, "Recent Deliveries" should show a successful ping-pong interaction.

## Example queries

Because we don't work with Ecto often and may forget.

    Repo.aggregate(Commit, :count)

    Repo.one(from c in Commit, limit: 1)

## What came before

We've reimplemented this app a few times to try out new tech:

* 2020: Remit II in Phoenix LiveView (and also to try out [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/))
* 2016: [Review](https://github.com/barsoom/review) in Phoenix/Elm
* 2014: [Remit I](https://github.com/henrik/remit) in Ruby on Rails with AngularJS and MessageBus
* 2014: [Hubreview](https://github.com/barsoom/hubreview) in Ruby on Rails with WebSockets

## Original instructions

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
