# Remit

## Dev

First time:

    # Creates DB, migrates, seeds
    mix ecto.setup

## Example queries

Because we don't work with Ecto often and may forget.

    alias Remit.{Repo,Commit}
    Repo.aggregate(Commit, :count)

## Original instructions

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
