# Remit with Elixir LiveView

A lab by Henrik ca 2020-05-15.

Focused on experimenting with LiveView so not very polished.

## Plan

More important:
- [ ] Highlighted comments
- [ ] Polish comments view
- [ ] Decide whether we want usecs in datetimes or not
- [ ] Unique index on commit sha (and handle gracefully when pushing)
- [ ] Save full payload to make future migrations easier?
- [ ] Error reporting (Honeybadger)

Fun polish:
- [ ] Tooltips
- [ ] Include reactions on comments in feed, not just comments proper
- [ ] Relative times here and there
- [ ] Show an indicator when you've been reviewing for a long time
- [ ] Can Remit steal back focus so non-Fluid-app usage works better?

Can wait until after we start using it:
- [ ] Consider case sensitivity with username matching
- [ ] Handle missed messages on reconnection (https://curiosum.dev/blog/elixir-phoenix-liveview-messenger-part-4?)
- [ ] More tests
- [ ] CI setup
- [ ] Devbox setup
- [ ] Docs (e.g. Fluid.app)
- [ ] Consider open sourcing
- [ ] Bump Heroku plan if needed
- [ ] Recurring job to remove old data
- [ ] Expiring old data

Done:
- [x] "Oldest commit" and similar stats at top
- [x] Settings tab
- [x] Basics
- [x] Add Tailwind
- [x] Store when Settings are read; expire old ones
- [x] Consider making it a single LiveView with multiple subcomponents, so switching between tabs is snappier
- [x] Styling
- [x] Polish settings tab
- [x] Highlight commits you're currently reviewing
- [x] Settings: nilify blanks
- [x] Gravatars
- [x] Store settings in session? https://github.com/martinsvalin/spyfall/pull/1/files
- [x] Maybe skip NProgress? Makes stuff feel slower than it is.
- [x] Lock down prod access
- [x] Get commits via webhook, cause clients to update
- [x] Proper link to oldest commit
- [x] Make separate copies of comments for each person who gets to see it
- [x] Polish commits view
- [x] Handle that a comment may not have an associated commit
- [x] Get comments via webhook, cause clients to update
- [x] Resolving comments
- [x] Filtering comments


## Usage

Remit is a self-hosted web app for [commit-by-commit code review](https://thepugautomatic.com/2014/02/code-review/), written using [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) [LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view). See below for instructions on setting it up.

You add a GitHub webhook to each repo you want to review (see instructions below). Then GitHub sends all new commits and comments to Remit.

Remit shows commits and lets you mark them as reviewed. Clicking a commit opens the commit page on GitHub, where you can write comments either line-by-line or on the commit as a whole.

Remit also shows you comments and lets you mark these as resolved, so you don't miss the feedback you got.

We recommend putting Remit inside [Fluid.app](https://fluidapp.com/) or equivalent so you can see Remit and the GitHub commit pages side-by-side.

### Setting up Fluid.app

TODO: Instructions

### Without Fluid.app

Links to commits will open in the same browser window/tab every time. So after clicking a link the first time, you can put this tab/window side-by-side with the Remit window (typically by dragging the tab out of the tab bar into its own window).

It won't be as convenient as with Fluid.app, but good in a pinch!


## Dev

Assumed to be run *outside* of devbox, at the time of writing.

First time:

    # Creates DB, migrates, seeds
    mix ecto.setup

Every time:

    mix phx.server

Then visit <http://localhost:4000?auth_key=dev>

You can run this to fake new commits coming in via webhook:

    mix wh.commits

### Maintenance

    mix deps.update --all    # Update Hex deps.
    cd assets && npm update  # Update JS deps.
    mix test                 # Verify things didn't break.

## Production

The `POOL_SIZE` for the running dyno is 18, so we've got 2 spare on a Heroku hobby plan.

Deploy:

    script/deploy

Console:

    script/prodc

Need to reset the DB on Heroku because you've rethought everything about the DB? Carefully:

    heroku pg:info  # Get DB name, e.g. dancing-nimbly-12345
    heroku pg:reset dancing-nimbly-12345
    heroku run "POOL_SIZE=2 mix ecto.migrate"

### Setup

Configure ENV variables for `AUTH_KEY` and `WEBHOOK_KEY`.

Add a webhook on each reviewed repo in GitHub (at Auctionet, we've got scripts to do this in batch).

The hook should be something like:

    Payload URL: https://my-remit.herokuapp.com/webhooks/github?auth_key=your_WEBHOOK_KEY_value
    Content type: application/json
    Secret: (left empty â€“ it's part of the URL instead)
    Select events:
    - Commit comments
    - Pushes

You should see a happy green checkmark on GitHub, and if you click the hook, "Recent Deliveries" should show a successful ping-pong interaction.

## Example queries

Because we don't work with Ecto often and may forget.

    Repo.aggregate(Commit, :count)

    Repo.one(from c in Commit, limit: 1)

## Original instructions

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
